                            Finally, Oedipus came to Thebes. In great despondency he found the city. Not only did the king die, the gods sent another attack: a monster Sphinx appeared near the city. It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the paws of a lion with sharp claws, and huge wings. The Sphinx made a riddle to all travelers and, if they didn’t guess it, threw people down from a high cliff. Many daredevils tried to find the answer to the riddle, and none of them survived. Oedipus also decided to try his luck. “It is better to die than to live in a foreign land as a rootless exile!” he thought.

                    <div class="tabs__item" id="tab_2">
                        <p>
                            He reached the rock where the Sphinx lived. "Make a riddle! I'm ready!" he said to the monster. “Tell me, if so brave, what creature walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening, and the more legs it has, the less strength?” the Sphinx asked. Oedipus laughed: “Your riddle is quite simple. This is a man. In the morning of his life, when he is still small and weak, he slowly crawls on all fours; during the day, that is, in adulthood, walks on two legs; in old age, in the evening of his life, he becomes decrepit and, in need of support, takes a crutch, which serves as his third leg.

                    <div class="tabs__item" id="tab_3">
                        <p>
                            The Sphinx heard the answer to her riddle, in desperation she threw herself down from the cliff and fell to her death. Oedipus returned to Thebes, and the citizens, admiring his resourcefulness, proclaimed him king. Oedipus took Queen Jocasta, the wife of the murdered Laius, as his wife, and began to rule Thebes. Soon his children were born: two daughters, Antigone and Ismene, and two sons, Eteocles and Polyneices. So the second half of the prediction was fulfilled: after all, Oedipus married his own mother.
